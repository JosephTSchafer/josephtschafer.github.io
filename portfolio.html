                                    <h3>Microsoft SQL Server</h3>
                                    <p>&emsp;Confident in querying capabilities when connecting to databases to perform SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements with additional clauses to refine results. Experienced in joining multiple tables on numerous conditions, as well as performing subqueries and querying on subtables. I have had experience with T-SQL with Stored Procedures in Triggers, and looking forward to the opportunity to using it more in the workplace. Currently I use Microsoft SQL Server on a daily basis at my current positon as an IT Intern at KFC Corporate.</p>

                                    <h3>Technical Writing, Documentation, Analysis, and Design</h3>
                                    <p>&emsp;Through experience both in the workplace as well as in the classroom as an undergraduate I have gained to opportunity 
                                        to explore technical writing and documentation through the Systems Development Lifecycle, Agile & Scrum methodologies,
                                         and explored data warehousing creation and visualization. <br>
                                         &emsp;When working as a Junior Systems Analyst with the University of Louisville School of Nursing, a partnership fostered 
                                        by the University of Louisville College of Business, a group of students and I were able to explore the opportunity 
                                        of creating a new Student Advising process. Through this we used different technical documents and processes such as 
                                        Semantic Modeling, Use Cases and Use Case diagrams, Class Diagrams, Gantt Charts, and performing a Cost-Benefit 
                                        Analysis. These techniques were used through an iterative process in order to produce a final Vision Document to 
                                        provide to the School of Nursing.<br>
                                        &emsp;Lastly, I have had the opportunity to create a basic Database Design using Class Diagrams and a Star Schema approach,
                                        giving me insight to database concepts that are consistent, durable, and potentially free from data anomalies and abnormalities.

                                    <h3>Microsoft PowerBI</h3>
                                    <p>&emsp;Creating material that is visually pleasing is enjoyable. Microsoft PowerBI opened up this door for me in a data-focused area. Being able to utilize both Microsoft SQL Server and Powershell to create visuals that help us understand underlying business trends is honestly exciting. I have had experience creating multiple dashboards that are updated daily to provide critical data to all levels of employees. I have experience in creating, publishingm, and updating PowerBI dashboards as well as creating new calculated fields with DAX. I have also attended the Microsoft sponsored "Dashboard in a Day" program to be introduced to key powerful features of Microsoft PowerBI.</p>

                                    <p>&emsp;Powershell has quickly become one of my preferred coding languages after continued use of it in my position as an IT Intern at KFC. I use it daily to perform tasks as simple as copying files from one location to another or compiling csv data, to tasks as complicated as updating PC file systems and software or creating thousands of unique XML's containing data that is required to be accurate for production purposes. Through my experience I have learned to utilize PowerShell in unique ways to help automate both business processes to alleviate redundant and repetitive tasks.</p>
