                        <p>
                               &emsp;A recent University of Louisville graduate seeking out new and engaging career
                               opportunities is how I would currently describe myself. In the business world I have come to enjoy
                               scripting and working with SQL. Learning to automate new tasks is a puzzle that there can be many 
                               solutions for and I discovering those solutions is satisfying! One of the best feelings is a sense of
                               personal achievement and I have come to strive for that whether in the workplace or in my personal life.
                               <br><br>
                               &emsp;I spend a good amount of my free time trying to both improve myself physically and preparing myself
                               for a future career. I enjoy working hard in the gym, weightlifting is a daily activity for me. Recently I have
                               come to appreciate cycling as well. Spending time exploring new coding languages and analysis concepts is entertaining
                               and at the same time challenging.
                               <br><br>
                               &emsp;Outside of the gym and working to further myself in my career I spend time gaming both online and in person 
                               with friends. The game I mainly play right now is Runescape, and I also spend time playing the board game Settlers
                               of Catan.
                               <br><br>
                               &emsp;In the workplace what I am seeking out most is a strong company culture where you can come to your job and enjoy
                               the people and the work you are doing. Being able to come into the workplace, work well with your team, and produce results
                               while being surrounded by people who like what they do is the culture I am seeking.
